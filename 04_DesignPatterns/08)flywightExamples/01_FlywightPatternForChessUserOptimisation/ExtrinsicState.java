/*
 * @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
 * This annotation specifies that the ExtrinsicState annotation should 
 * be retained at runtime. This means that the annotation will be
 *  available through reflection during runtime.
 * 
 * 
 * @Target(ElementType.TYPE)
 * This annotation specifies that the ExtrinsicState annotation can 
 * only be applied to types (i.e., classes, interfaces, enums, and 
 * annotation types).
 * 
 * public @interface ExtrinsicState
 * This declares a custom annotation called ExtrinsicState.
 * 
 * 
 * Thus, The ExtrinsicState annotation is likely being used to mark or 
 * categorize certain classes. Given the name, it might be related to 
 * the Flyweight design pattern, where the annotation is used to indicate
 *  that a class contains extrinsic state informationâ€”state that varies 
 * independently and is supplied externally to the shared objects 
 * (intrinsic state).
